    <li>Email addresses are also securely stored in the encrypted database to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
    <li>Encryption keys are securely managed using Fly.io Secret Manager.</li>
    <li>All communications are enforced via HTTPS to prevent data leakage during transmission.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <p>For any such requests, please contact the bot administrator via Discord DM or through the designated channel. We will respond promptly.</p>

  <h2>7. Use of Cookies</h2>
